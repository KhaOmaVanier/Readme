1. Tell me about your programming experience.

2. Languages that you are COMFORTABLE in.

3. What are your future aspirations in computer programming?

4. What do you like best about Computer Programming?

5. What do you like least about Computer Programming?

My programming experience consists of Grade 10 and Grade 11 computer science courses, as well as some side projects that I have done with my father and brother. I am comfortable in languages such as turing and pascal, and have some background practice in C++. I am considering learning new languages such as Python and Java for my Grade 12 course and future projects that I might encounter in the future. I actually do not have any future aspirations career wise with computer programming, because I would like to grow up
to become a surgeon, but I have no problems with future projects between my friends and I in the future. The thing I like best about computer programming is the abstract thinking needed in order to write an efficient program with no errors, while the thing I like least is the subtle difference of syntax between multiple languages which at times can cause some confusion.
