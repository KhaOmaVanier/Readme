My programming experience consists of Grade 10 and Grade 11 computer science courses, as well as some side projects that I have done with
my father and brother. I am comfortable in languages such as turing and pascal, and have some background practice in C++. I am considering 
learning new languages such as Python and Java for my Grade 12 course and future projects that I might encounter in the future.
